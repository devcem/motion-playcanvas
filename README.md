# PlayCanvas Motion
Motion.js is a lightweight plugin for PlayCanvas that allows you to create simple animations with timeline functionality. With Motion.js, you can easily move boxes or objects around in your scene, loop them nicely, and control their playback speed and direction.

## Features
Timeline editor: Motion.js includes a simple timeline editor that lets you create and edit animations by adding keyframes and adjusting their properties (such as position, rotation, scale, and opacity).

Flexible interpolation: Motion.js supports various interpolation methods (such as linear, quadratic, cubic, and elastic) to smoothly transition between keyframes and create realistic motion.

Looping options: Motion.js provides several looping options (such as loop, ping-pong, and yoyo) to control how the animation repeats and plays.

## Getting started
To use Motion.js in your PlayCanvas project, simply add the motion.js file to your project and include it in your script:
